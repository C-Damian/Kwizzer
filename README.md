#Kwizzer
Kwizzer is a personal project where I'm building an interactive quiz platform to explore and practice full-stack development. My goal is to create a flexible foundation for custom quiz experiences, with features like question banks, user authentication, scoring, and analytics. üöÄ

## Why Kwizzer?

I'm using Kwizzer to sharpen my skills in designing scalable systems, creating and implementing complex APIs, and crafting user-friendly interfaces. It‚Äôs a playground for experimenting with new technologies and architectural patterns, while also having fun building something useful.

## Project Goals

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean and intuitive UI for quiz creators and participants.
- **Customizable Quizzes:** Multiple question types, timed quizzes, and flexible scoring.
- **Scalability:** Modular architecture for easy feature expansion.
- **Analytics:** Track user performance and quiz stats.

## Current Features

- Core quiz engine for managing questions and scoring.
- Basic user authentication and session handling.
- RESTful API endpoints for quiz creation and participation.
- Initial frontend components for quiz interaction.

## What‚Äôs Next?

- More question types (multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank).
- Real-time multiplayer quiz support. üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë
- Advanced analytics and reporting.
- Friendly UI/UX for desktop and mobile.
